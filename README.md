# snake

This is my final project for my first computer science course at Penn. 

This is the basic implementation of Snake where the user moves the snake around the board using the arrow keys, and the goal is for the user is eat the food and get their score as high as possible. There are additional features, such as storing and displaying high scores and allowing the user to pick the amount of food they want on the board at a time.
